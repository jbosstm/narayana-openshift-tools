== How to release

Release is performed to JBoss Nexus and you need to have credentials for it.
The JBoss Nexus respository can be found at https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/.

Credentials for release needs to be setup in the `~/.m2/settings.xml`
where you link the repository id `jboss-releases-repository` with the username/password.

```xml
<server>
    <id>jboss-releases-repository</id>
    <username>[username]</username>
    <password>[password for jboss nexus connection]</password>
</server>
```

As the next step run the `mvn release` and proceed standard steps
(see details e.g. at http://maven.apache.org/maven-release/maven-release-plugin/usage.html)
while there is used nexus staging plugin for this purpose.

* `mvn release:clean`
* `mvn release:prepare`
* `mvn release:perform`

if you want to  just check if runs fine
`mvn release:prepare -DdryRun=true`
